## Hi there 👋

I'm Yann LE RAY, currently pursuing a dual degree in Mathematics and Computer Science.

I enjoy designing apps and video games whenever I have time to work on side projects.

If a challenge seems too hard, I’ll try even harder — I love pushing my limits.

My main tools are Eclipse and Notepad++, and I often use pen and paper to sketch ideas or take notes.

Feel free to reach out: ynnleray@gmail.com
